#  User Journey – Error Tracker

#Goal: Log a frontend error during testing

# Steps

1. **User opens the Error Tracker HTML page**
   - Motivation: Begin a QA or testing session
2. **User sees a simple form with "Error Title" and "Description"**
   - Feels: Ready to use it instantly
3. **User enters error details and clicks "Add Error"**
   - Expects: The issue is saved and listed below
4. **User reviews the tracked errors**
   - Checks: Can edit/delete if needed
5. **User finishes session**
   - Might: Export or screenshot list



## Notes

- No signup → Fast onboarding
- Frontend-only → Works offline
- Great for small projects, devs, and testers
