## Git Branching

- Use the following branch prefixes:
  - `feature/` – for new features (e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode`)
  - `bugfix/` – for fixing issues (e.g., `bugfix/delete-button-bug`)
  - `hotfix/` – for urgent production issues

- Always branch off from `main` and submit a Pull Request (PR).
