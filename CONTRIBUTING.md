## Git Branching

- Use the following branch prefixes:
  - `feature/` – for new features (e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode`)
  - `bugfix/` – for fixing issues (e.g., `bugfix/delete-button-bug`)
  - `hotfix/` – for urgent production issues

- Always branch off from `main` and submit a Pull Request (PR).

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` – new feature
- `fix:` – bug fix
- `docs:` – documentation only
- `refactor:` – code change that doesn’t add new feature or fix a bug
- `chore:` – maintenance tasks (e.g., dependencies)

**Examples:**
- `feat: add error priority tagging`
- `fix: resolve localStorage sync bug`
